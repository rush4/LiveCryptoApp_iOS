# LiveCryptoApp
LiveCrypto is a simple cryptocurrency app designed to display prices and historical data for various cryptocurrencies.

The app features a list of available cryptocurrencies, each accompanied by an image, name, and current price. Users can refresh the list by swiping vertically.

Selecting a cryptocurrency allows users to view its details, which include:

Two charts displaying price data for the past week.
Historical data for the cryptocurrency.
A link to the cryptocurrency's dedicated website.
LiveCrypto is built using SwiftUI, MVI, and Coordinator. Additionally, it includes a unit test class for fetching methods and a retry button to handle server errors, such as receiving a "429" status code.

Any suggestions are appreciated. Thank you for your time.
